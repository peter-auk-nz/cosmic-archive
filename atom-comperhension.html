Understanding Atoms
An atom has a nucleus at the centre
Electron in shells around the nucleus
The electrons and nucleus have opposing forces (negative electrons, positive protons)
Atoms form bonds
A single atom is an element-heading
One gold atom = gold (element #79)
One hydrogen atom = hydrogen (element #1)
One unranium atom = unranium (element #92)

What defines the element is the number of protons in the nucleus

1 proton = hydrogen
6 protons = carbon
79 protons = gold
One atom is the smallest unit of an element
Many atoms bonded together make up an element you can see
Like a gold nugget, or water molecules

 
Now let's go deeper inside the nucleus

Protons (posivitve charge)
Neutrons (no charge)
Neutrons and protons are not fundamental! They are made of even tinier things called quarks
Each proton = 3 quarks (2 "up" quarks + 1 "down" quark)
Each neutron = 3 quarks (1 "up" quark + 2 "down" quarks)


What holds these quarks together
Gluons hold the quarks together
The hierarchy is

Quarks + gluons = protons and nuetrons
Protons and neutrons = nucleus
Nucleus + electrons = atom
Atoms = elements
Trillions of atoms = visible matter

The fundamental particles (as far as we know)
Quarks (6 types, or "flavours")

Up, down (these make protons and neutrons)
Charm, strange
Top, bottom. These are truly fundamental - Not made of anything smaller

Leptons (6 types)

Electrons
Muon, Tau (heavier versions of electrons)
Three types of neutrinos (ghostly particles that barely interact)

Force carriers (particles that transmit force)

Gluons (holds quarks together - "strong force")
Photons (light! "electromagnetic force")
W and Z Bosons ("weak force" - causes radioactive decay)
Graviton (hypothetical - gravitiy, not yet found)

The Higgs Boson

Gives other particles mass! Discovered 2012

This is the amazing part. All of these are not really "particles" - they are ripples in quantum fields!
