# Understanding Atoms
## The makeup of atoms

- An atom has a nucleus at the centre

- Electron in shells around the nucleus

- The electrons and nucleus have opposing forces (negative electrons, positive protons)

- Atoms form bonds

## A single atom is an element

- One gold atom = gold (element #79)

- One hydrogen atom = hydrogen (element #1)

- One unranium atom = uranium (element #92)

## What defines the element is the number of protons in the nucleus

- 1 proton = hydrogen

- 6 protons = carbon

- 79 protons = gold

## Atoms: Single vs many

- One atom is the smallest unit of an element

- Many atoms bonded together make up an element you can see like a gold nugget, or water molecules

## Now let's go deeper inside the nucleus
**The nucleus contains**

- Protons (positive charge)

- Neutrons (no charge)

## Neutrons and protons are not fundamental!

They are made up of tinier things called **quarks**

- Each proton → 3 quarks (2 "up" quarks + 1 "down" quark)

- Each neutron → 3 quarks (1 "up" quark + 2 "down" quarks)

## What holds these quarks together?

**Gluons** they glue the the quarks together. (That's why they are called that)

## The hierarchy:

- Quarks + gluons → protons and neutrons

- Protons and neutrons → nucleus

- Nucleus + electrons → atom

- Atoms → elements

- Trillions of atoms → visible matter

## The fundamental particles (as far as we know)

### 1. Quarks (6 types, or "flavours")

**Up, down** (these make protons and neutrons)

**Charm, strange**

**Top, bottom**

These are **truly fundamental** - not made of anything smaller!

### 2. Leptons (6 types)

- **Electrons**

- **Muon, Tau** (heavier versions of electrons)

- **3 Types of neutrinos** (ghostly particles that barely interact)

### 3. Force carriers (particles that transmit force)

- **Gluons** (glue quarks together - "strong force")

- **Photons** (light! "Electromagnetic force")

- **W and Z Bosons** ("weak force" - causes radioactive decay)

- Graviton (hypothetical - gravity, not yet found)

### 4. The Higgs Boson

- Gives other particles mass! Discovered 2012

## Quantum fields

Imagine the ocean. The water is always there, but when energy disturbs it, you get waves. The waves aren't separate from the ocean - they're the ocean vibrating!

**Quantum fields** work the same way:

- There's an **electron field** everywhere in space

- When that field gets energy, it vibrates

- That vibration is what is called an **electron**

**Every** type of particle has its own field filling **all** of space:

- Electron field → vibrations = electrons
- Quark field → vibrations = quarks
- Photon field → vibrations = light particles (photons!)
- Higgs field → vibrations = Higgs bosons

These fields exist **everywhere**, always. Right now, where you're sitting, there are **electron fields**, **quark fields**, **photon fields** - all layered on top of each other!
